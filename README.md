######## Ansible playbook for deploy wordpress########

Step1: Set up AWS credentials: To interact with AWS services using Ansible, you'll need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating an AWS Access Key and Secret Access Key in the AWS IAM Console and storing them in a secure location. Then, configure the AWS CLI on your local machine and use the aws configure command to set up the credentials

Step2: Set up the EC2 instance: Use the AWS Management Console to launch an EC2 instance running Linux. Make sure to select a VPC, subnet, and security group that allow inbound traffic on port 22 for SSH access and port 80 for HTTP access. Take note of the EC2 instance's public IP address, as you'll need this to configure Ansible later on.

Step3: Install necessary packages: Your EC2 instance may need some additional packages to run WordPress. In your Ansible playbook, use the yum module to install the required packages. For example, you may need to install the Apache web server, PHP, and MySQL.

Step4: Download WordPress: Use the get_url module to download the latest version of WordPress from the WordPress website. Extract the WordPress files to the appropriate directory (e.g. /var/www/html/wordpress).

Step5: Configure WordPress: Use the template module to generate a wp-config.php file for WordPress. This file contains configuration details for connecting to the MySQL database, among other things. Use the mysql_db and mysql_user modules to create a MySQL database and user for WordPress, respectively. Finally, use the replace module to update the WordPress configuration file with the appropriate database connection details.

Step6: Configure Apache: Use the template module to generate an Apache configuration file for WordPress. This file should contain directives for serving WordPress content and redirecting HTTP traffic to HTTPS (if desired). Use the service module to restart the Apache web server to apply the configuration changes.

Step7: Create a playbook: Combine the above steps into a single Ansible playbook. Define variables for the AWS credentials, EC2 instance IP address, and any other configuration details. Use the hosts directive to specify the EC2 instance to target. Run the playbook with the ansible-playbook command.

########## docker image and run your Ansible playbook on #######

follow steps describe the docker image

Step1: starts with a slim version of the Python 3.9 Docker image.

Step2: installs necessary packages for running Ansible and other tools.

Step3: It sets up a working directory and copies the Ansible playbook and script to add a post to WordPress to the container.

Step4: It installs the requests Python package for the script to add a post.

Step5: Finally, it runs the Ansible playbook to set up the WordPress site, and then starts an infinite loop that runs the script to add a post every hour.

         ############ add_post.py #############
            
below statement explains the docker container add one post to the WordPress site every hour,

Step1: we are using the JSONPlaceholder API, which allows us to simulate a RESTful API. We define the URL for the API endpoint where we want to add the post, and we create a dictionary containing the data for the post. We then use the requests.post() method to send the data to the API. If the response status code is 201, we assume that the post was added successfully. Otherwise, we print an error message.
